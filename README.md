# Welcome!

This is (as you could tell by the name) a Netflix clone built using React.

There is not much to say the page is basically the front page of netflix.

It is been hosted using firebase and it is up and running.

The movie database <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US" alt="page site">API<a/> was used to display movies images and videos. If an image or a video doesn't show that's because the database doesn't have it stored.

### <a href="https://netflox-d7a44.web.app/" alt="page site">HERE<a/>
  
I don't know how long it will be running but I will provably take it offline after a while or after the hosting site takes it offline.
